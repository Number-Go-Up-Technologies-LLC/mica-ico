# MiCA-Compliant ICO Program (Solana/Anchor)

It is built for the **Solana** blockchain using the **Anchor** framework.

## Motivation & Philosophy

The primary purpose of this release is to promote **privacy-preserving, regulation-compliant** token offerings.

Since the first MiCA-compliant public offer, numerous subsequent offerings – including those on EU-regulated exchanges – have unnecessarily mandated **KYC ("Know Your Customer")** processes for participants.

**Crucially, MiCA does NOT require KYC for participation in a public offer.**

Unnecessarily implementing KYC:
* Exposes users to **increased privacy risks**.
* Restricts the total pool of available investors.

NGUT offers this source code to **reduce the number of projects that unnecessarily require KYC** from their users, facilitating broader and more private access to token offerings.
